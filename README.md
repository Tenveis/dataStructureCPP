# C++ Data Structures Library

## Introduction

This C++ Data Structures Library is a learning-oriented project that aims to provide a collection of various data structures, such as linked lists, stack,  and more, implemented in C++. The project is organized using CMake, making it easy to build and integrate with your C++ applications. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding and experimenting with fundamental data structures in **C++**.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Each data structure is implemented as a separate library, allowing you to use and test them individually.

- **CMake Build System**: The project uses CMake as a build system, making it cross-platform and easy to compile.

- **Educational Purpose**: This project is intended for educational purposes, making it a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with data structures.

## Supported Data Structures

The library currently includes the following data structures:

- **LinkedList**: A classic singly-linked list.
- **DoublyLinkedList**: A doubly-linked list with forward and backward traversal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **CMake**: Make sure you have CMake installed on your system. You can download it from [CMake's official website](https://cmake.org/download/).

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tenveis/dataStructureCPP
   cd dataStructureCPP
    ```

2. Create a build directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Configure the project with CMake:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you'd like to contribute a new data structure or improvements to existing ones, please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the project.
- Create a feature branch.
- Implement your changes.
- Write tests to validate your implementation.
- Submit a pull request.

### Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the desire to create a resource for learning and experimenting with data structures in C++.
